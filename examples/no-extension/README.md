Demonstrates that react-svg handles SVG files served without a file extension,
provided the server responds with an appropriate content type.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Builds the app with Vite, starts an Express server on port 8080, and opens the
browser automatically.
